# Overview

## Have you ever seen the youtube videos on sorting algorithms and you were like, huh, that sorts the items!
---
### Well this is exactly what this program does! I decided to take on the challenge of learning a multitude of sorting algorithms and compile them all together to be one giant learning experience for me, and other like-minded individuals who want to learn more about data analysis.
---
### This software is compiled of a grand total of 11 sorting algorithms.

#### These sorting algorithms include:
- [Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)
- [Insert Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/)
- [Selection Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/)
- [Radix Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/radix-sort/)
- [Shell Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shellsort/)
- [Stooge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stooge-sort/)
- [Cocktail Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cocktail-sort/)
- [Gnome Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gnome-sort-a-stupid-one/)
- [Bogo Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bogosort-permutation-sort/)
- [Odd-Even Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/odd-even-sort-brick-sort/)
- [Pancake Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pancake-sorting/)
---
## Each Algorithm will be shown on screen with a total of 35 items, while bogo has 8 items.
#### (read more on [bogo sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bogosort-permutation-sort/))

### It will start the permutations slowly and then speed up as you see what's happening with each algorithm so that you don't have to wait very long for the algorithms to complete.
---

### I initially wanted to make this software because I noticed that while many youtube videos are very informative on how "efficient" each algorithm is, they just managed to not show the full statistics.

### With this software you can see in real time how the items are being sorted, which items are being compared, and how many iterations it took to sort that algorithm.
